======
20100726T1355

 - changed: FP-QUI no longer initializes config.ini on start, since this is done by FP-QUICore anyways. This should slightly increase performance.

======
20100726T1341489

 - fixed: when FP-Core is not yet running and launched with parameters, it does not process them

======
20100714T203992

20100708T041106

 - updated documentation

======
20100705T0321765

 - multiple buttons are displayed side by side, the width is determined automatically
 - new option: minimumFontSize ... specifies the minimum font size that is used when no font size is specified and auto-font-downsizing is applied (to make the notification fit into the dispatcher-area)

======
20100624T0559607

 - changed name to FP-QInterface

======
20100624T0402338

======
20100530T0359999

 - new CL option: <createIfNotVisible> 
... <>"": If you update a notification declaring a winhandle and it's not visible this will automatically fall back to creating a new one. This will not work with update, since only part of the signature of the notification is provided (doesn't make sense).
=="" (default): no auto create
 - slightly improved performance

======
20100525T1408809

 - named pipes do no longer use string reverse (which was thought to increase security, but, in fact, is useless and causes interop problems)
 - named pipes include was changed: a new method allows one to create a new pipe manually

======
20100509T2044

 - FP-NotifierBeeper will no longer crash on invalid arguments

======
20100509T20

======
20100430T23

 - revised error handling
 - minor bug fixes

======
1.6

	improved singleton handling

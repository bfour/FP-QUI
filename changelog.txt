- updated documentation


======
20100705T0321765

 - multiple buttons are displayed side by side, the width is determined automatically
 - new option: minimumFontSize ... specifies the minimum font size that is used when no font size is specified and auto-font-downsizing is applied (to make the notification fit into the dispatcher-area)


======
20100624T0559607

- changed name to FP-QInterface


======
20100624T0402338

======
20100530T0359999

 - new CL option: <createIfNotVisible> 
... <>"": If you update a notification declaring a winhandle and it's not visible this will automatically fall back to creating a new one. This will not work with update, since only part of the signature of the notification is provided (doesn't make sense).
=="" (default): no auto create
 - slightly improved performance


======
20100525T1408809

 - named pipes do no longer use string reverse (which was thought to increase security, but, in fact, is useless and just causes interop problems)
 - named pipes include was changed: a new method allows one to create a new pipe manually


======

FP-NotifierBeeper will no longer crash on invalid arguments


======
20100509T20
